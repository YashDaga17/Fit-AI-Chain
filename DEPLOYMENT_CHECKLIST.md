### Environment Setup Required for Production

```bash
# Required Environment Variables for Vercel:
NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_APP_ID=app_staging_xxx  # or your production app ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_ACTION=verify-human     # optional, defaults to verify-human
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete World ID verification and onboarding improvements"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_APP_ID` to your World ID app ID
   - Optionally set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_ACTION` if using custom action

3. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy from your main branch
   - Monitor build logs to ensure successful deployment

### Testing on Production

1. **World App Users**: Open in World App, verify seamless flow
2. **Web Users**: Visit in browser, test "Verify with World ID" button
3. **Guest Users**: Test guest mode functionality and data persistence  
4. **Error Cases**: Test with invalid verification data
