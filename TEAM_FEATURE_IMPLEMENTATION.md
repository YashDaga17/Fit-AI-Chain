- **Real-time Updates**: Meal status and stakes update after food entry submission

### Database Integration
- **User Management**: WorldID verification integration with database user creation
- **Food Entry Storage**: Enhanced food entries with team, stake, and meal type associations
- **Stats Tracking**: User stats persistence and history tracking
- **Meal Windows**: Dynamic meal window creation and status tracking
- **Stake Management**: Complete stake lifecycle from creation to finalization

## üöÄ HOW TO TEST

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd /Users/yashdaga/Desktop/dev/Fit-AI-Chain
npm run dev
```

### 2. Initialize Database
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/init-db` to initialize the database
2. Verify the connection is successful

### 3. Test User Flow
1. **Home Page**: Verify with WorldID (or skip for testing)
2. **Tracker Page**: 
   - Take a food photo to test basic functionality
   - Check if Teams button appears in navigation
3. **Teams Page**: 
   - Create a new group
   - Search for users (mock data will be available)
   - Create stakes within groups
4. **Team Competition**:
   - Join a stake
   - Upload food during active meal windows
   - View leaderboard updates

### 4. Test Team Features
- **Group Privacy**: Only group members see each other's posts
- **Meal Windows**: Test breakfast/lunch/dinner time restrictions
- **Image Requirements**: Verify minimum 2 images per meal
- **Stake Rewards**: Test stake pool distribution logic
- **Real-time Updates**: Check leaderboard updates after food entries

## üìù ENVIRONMENT SETUP

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Database (Neon PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_url"

# AI Analysis (optional for testing)
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
```

### Dependencies
All necessary dependencies are already in `package.json`:
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- UI components (custom)

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Testing Priorities
1. **Database Connection**: Ensure Neon PostgreSQL is connected
2. **User Authentication**: Test WorldID integration
3. **Team Creation**: Test group and stake creation flows
4. **Food Logging**: Test team-aware food entry submission
5. **Competition Logic**: Verify meal window and stake mechanics

### Production Considerations
1. **Image Storage**: Currently using base64, should upgrade to cloud storage
2. **Real-time Updates**: Consider WebSocket integration for live leaderboards
3. **Push Notifications**: Meal window reminders and competition updates
4. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error boundaries and user feedback
5. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and caching

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is correctly set
2. **TypeScript Errors**: All errors have been resolved in this implementation
3. **Missing Functions**: All team-related functions have been implemented
4. **Navigation**: Teams button added to tracker page navigation

### Error Resolution
- All TypeScript compilation errors have been fixed
- Missing function definitions have been added
- Meal selection dialog has been implemented
- Team data loading functions are properly integrated
